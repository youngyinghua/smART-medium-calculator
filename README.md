# smART-medium-calculator

This app is build to sovle a problem in my job as an embryologist.
This app is helpful to calculator embryo cultrue medium needed and
may help make an order timely and correctly without waste.

My in-vitro firtilizaiton (IVF) lab needs to order embryo medium for
embryo culture from the dealer. The medium, however, can not preserved
for a long time, it will expire is several weeks. Most treatments in
artificial reproductive techonology (ART) consume embryo culture medium and
they consume different volumes. For example, c-IVF, ICSI and split
(combination of c-IVF and ICSI) comsume medium depends on the embryo count
for each time; FET and ET, however, do not depends on the count, they consume
a fixed volume each time.

This app is based on three-months-calendar, an user could

1. add/delete a treatment event by click plus/minus icon in any day of calendar;
2. move events among days of calendar by dragging;
3. set medium consuming conditions by click setting icon;
4. estimate medium volumes needed after determine an interval;
