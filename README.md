# smART-medium-calculator

This app is build to sovle a problem encountered as an embryologist at work.
It can help to estimate the amount of cultrue medium needed to culture embryos and
may be a good guide in making an new order timely and correctly.

In the in-vitro firtilizaiton (IVF) lab I am working, we need to order embryo medium for
embryo culture from the dealers. The medium, however, can not preserved
for a long time, it could expire within several weeks. Depending on treatments of
artificial reproductive techonology (ART), embryo culture medium could be
consumed differently in terms of volume. For example, c-IVF, ICSI and split
(combination of c-IVF and ICSI) comsume medium depends on the embryo count
for each time; FET and ET, however, do not depends on the count, they consume
a fixed volume each time.

This app is based on three-months-calendar, one could

1. add/delete a treatment event by click plus/minus icon in any day of calendar;
2. move events among days of calendar by dragging;
3. set medium consuming conditions by click setting icon;
4. estimate medium volumes needed after determine an interval;
